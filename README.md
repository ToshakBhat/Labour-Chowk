**Labour Chowk**
This is an android application aims to bridge the gap between daily wage labourers and employers.
The app uses Google Technologies like Google Cloud, Firebase, Android Studio

**Google Cloud** : The project Labour Chowk is created on Google Cloud to get free access to Gemini Pro.
**Firebase** : To connect labour with employer in real-time, I have used Firebase Realtime database. Also to verify the users, OTP based login system is created using FireBase Authentication.
**Android Studio** : The android app is made in android studio using JAVA and XML.

Currently the application is not hosted on the Play Store but can be downloaded from the following link : https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/c9sjpr5eazw8nl879t40l/app-debug.apk?rlkey=deqo6povlb834qd43dmbo02ru&e=1
